# Project CNN: A Comprehensive Collection of Convolutional Neural Network Projects

Welcome to the Project CNN repository! This repository hosts a diverse collection of convolutional neural network (CNN) projects aimed at solving real-world problems using advanced deep learning techniques. Whether you're a researcher, developer, or enthusiast, you'll find valuable resources and codebases to accelerate your machine learning projects.
## List of projects
This repository includes several specialized CNN projects. Each project has its own dedicated directory with detailed documentation and code. Below is a list of the projects currently available:
 - [fire detection](https://github.com/AABOLFAZLSOHRABI/CNN/tree/64a4e890babfca9f4687ab25be180ffcca3ea720/fire%20detection)

   This project focuses on detecting fire in images and videos using convolutional neural networks. Early detection of fire can be crucial in preventing large-scale disasters. The model is trained on a diverse dataset to accurately identify fire in various conditions and environments.
 - [Smoking detection](https://github.com/AABOLFAZLSOHRABI/CNN/tree/fedfc9eeb541058471e664e210afd420ad75f178/Smoking%20detection)

   The Smoking Detection project utilizes CNNs to identify individuals smoking in public spaces. This tool can be used to enforce smoking regulations and maintain smoke-free zones. The dataset includes images of people in various poses and lighting conditions to ensure robustness.
 - [Hard Hat detection](https://github.com/AABOLFAZLSOHRABI/CNN/tree/381f5e4e8eb6a3b09b903345979baa81e9199d1d/Hard%20Hat%20detection)

   Safety in the workplace is paramount. This project aims to detect the presence of hard hats on construction sites using CNNs. The model helps ensure that safety protocols are followed by identifying workers who are not wearing the required protective gear.
