# Smoking Detection with YOLO V10n Model

Welcome to the Smoking Detection project using the YOLO V10n model! This project leverages the latest advances in convolutional neural networks and deep learning to accurately detect smoking in images and videos. Whether you are a researcher, developer, or enthusiast in the field of computer vision, this repository provides valuable resources and code to aid in the detection of smoking in various environments.

## Overview

Smoking detection is a critical application in many fields, including sensitive environments such as healthcare facilities, schools, and industrial areas where smoking is prohibited. Early detection of smoking can help enforce regulations, promote a healthier environment, and prevent potential hazards. This project utilizes the YOLO V10n model, a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm, to identify smoking activities in real-time.

## YOLO V10n Model

The YOLO (You Only Look Once) V10n model is an advanced version of the popular YOLO object detection framework. Known for its speed and accuracy, YOLO V10n can process images and videos rapidly while maintaining high detection precision. This makes it ideal for applications where real-time smoking detection is crucial.

## Application in Sensitive or Industrial Environments

This smoking detection model can be particularly useful in sensitive or industrial environments where smoking is prohibited. Implementing this detection system can help enforce non-smoking policies, improve safety, and promote a healthier atmosphere.

### Key Features of YOLO V10n:

- **High Speed**: Capable of real-time processing.
- **Accuracy**: High precision in detecting objects, including small and partially obscured smoking activities.
- **Efficiency**: Optimized for both performance and computational efficiency.

## Dataset

The model is trained using a comprehensive [smoking detection dataset](https://universe.roboflow.com/cigarette-detector/cigarettes-reality-2) provided by Roboflow. This dataset includes a variety of images depicting smoking in different environments and conditions, ensuring that the model can generalize well to real-world scenarios.

### Dataset Details:

- **Variety**: Includes images of smoking in different settings, such as urban areas, public places, and industrial environments.
- **Annotations**: Each image is annotated with bounding boxes to indicate the presence and location of smoking.
- **Quality**: High-resolution images to improve model training and accuracy.

## Results

The YOLO V10n model demonstrates excellent performance in detecting smoking across various conditions. Below are some example outputs from the model:
